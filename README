Hydra
=====

This is a project for my school which involves creating an Android App.
I decided to go with a game that's sort of a Zelda-remake.
In case you're wondering, hydra is just a code-name to work with.
I decided on it because:
	a) it sounds cool
	b) programming is sometimes like fighting a hydra:
	   as soon as one bug is solved, another one gets ready to bite you
	   in the neck

I'll add to this README once i get some thing's working.
